# 🎭 WhatsApp System Design - QA Conversation Simulation

## 🎯 Interview Scenario: Senior Software Engineer Position
**Interviewer**: Sarah (Staff Engineer at Meta)
**Candidate**: You
**Duration**: 30-minute system design round

---

## 🚀 Phase 1: Requirements Clarification (5 minutes)

**👩‍💼 Sarah**: "Let's design a chat application like WhatsApp. What questions do you have about the requirements?"

**🧑‍💻 You**: "Great! Let me clarify a few key aspects:
1. What's our target scale - are we talking millions or billions of users?
2. Should I focus on mobile-first or include web clients?
3. What's more important - message delivery speed or guaranteed delivery?
4. Do we need to support features like groups, media sharing, and voice calls?"

**👩‍💼 Sarah**: "Good questions. Let's say 1 billion users, 500M daily active. Mobile-first but include web. Prioritize guaranteed delivery over speed, but keep latency under 100ms. Yes to groups and media, skip voice calls for now."

**🧑‍💻 You**: "Perfect. One more clarification - should I assume we need end-to-end encryption, and what's our consistency model? Can we accept eventual consistency for delivery status?"

**👩‍💼 Sarah**: "Yes to encryption, and eventual consistency is fine for receipts. Users care more about getting messages than perfect ordering."

---

## 📊 Phase 2: Capacity Estimation (4 minutes)

**👩‍💼 Sarah**: "Walk me through the numbers."

**🧑‍💻 You**: "Let me break this down:

**Message Volume:**
- 500M DAU × 20 messages/day = 10B messages/day
- That's about 115K QPS average, 350K peak QPS

**Storage:**
- Average message: 600 bytes
- Daily storage: 6TB just for text
- With media (let's say 20% of messages), we're looking at 4-5PB daily

**Bandwidth:**
- Inbound: ~120MB/s
- Outbound: ~350MB/s (accounting for fanout)"

**👩‍💼 Sarah**: "Your media estimate seems high. How did you get 4-5PB daily?"

**🧑‍💻 You**: "Good catch! I assumed 20% of 10B messages have media at 2MB average. That's 2B × 2MB = 4PB. But realistically, most media is probably compressed images under 500KB, so maybe 1PB daily is more realistic."

**👩‍💼 Sarah**: "Better. Continue."

---

## 🏗️ Phase 3: High-Level Design (10 minutes)

**🧑‍💻 You**: "Here's my high-level architecture:

```
Mobile Apps → Load Balancer → WebSocket Gateway
                                      ↓
              API Gateway ← Chat Service → Message Queue
                  ↓              ↓            ↓
            Microservices    Cassandra    Workers
            (User/Media)        ↓            ↓
                  ↓          Redis      Push Service
              PostgreSQL       ↓
                         Presence Service
```

Key components:
- **WebSocket Gateway**: Maintains persistent connections
- **Chat Service**: Core message routing and business logic  
- **Kafka**: Message queue for async processing
- **Cassandra**: Message storage (write-optimized)
- **Redis**: Caching, presence, deduplication"

**👩‍💼 Sarah**: "Why Cassandra over MongoDB or even PostgreSQL for messages?"

**🧑‍💻 You**: "Great question. Three main reasons:
1. **Write performance**: Cassandra handles 350K writes/second much better than PostgreSQL
2. **Horizontal scaling**: We can partition by chat_id and scale linearly
3. **TTL support**: Built-in expiration for old messages without performance impact

MongoDB could work, but Cassandra's eventual consistency model aligns better with our chat use case."

**👩‍💼 Sarah**: "What about message ordering? How do you handle race conditions in group chats?"

**🧑‍💻 You**: "Excellent point. I'd use a hybrid approach:
1. **Vector clocks**: Each client maintains logical timestamps
2. **Server timestamps**: Cassandra adds server-side timestamps as tiebreakers
3. **Conflict resolution**: Clients merge and reorder based on vector clocks

For groups, the chat service acts as a sequencer, assigning incremental sequence numbers per chat_id."

**👩‍💼 Sarah**: "That sounds complex. What if the chat service goes down?"

**🧑‍💻 You**: "Fair concern. I'd implement:
1. **Stateless chat services**: Multiple instances behind load balancer
2. **Sticky sessions**: Users connect to same instance for session continuity
3. **Graceful failover**: Redis stores connection state, new instance can resume
4. **Message buffering**: Kafka retains messages during service restart"

---

## 🔬 Phase 4: Deep Dive Questions (8 minutes)

**👩‍💼 Sarah**: "Let's dive deeper. How exactly does a message flow from sender to receiver?"

**🧑‍💻 You**: "Here's the detailed flow:

1. **Sender** encrypts message client-side, sends via WebSocket
2. **WebSocket Gateway** validates auth token, routes to Chat Service
3. **Chat Service** assigns message ID (UUIDv7), stores in Cassandra
4. **Immediate ACK** sent to sender (message persisted)
5. **Kafka event** published for async delivery
6. **Online receivers**: Chat service pushes via existing WebSocket connections
7. **Offline receivers**: Workers queue push notifications
8. **Receipt updates**: Delivered/read status flows back through same pipeline"

**👩‍💼 Sarah**: "How do you prevent duplicate messages?"

**🧑‍💻 You**: "Multi-layer approach:
1. **Client-side**: UUIDv7 message IDs (client generates)
2. **Redis dedup**: Store message IDs with 24-hour TTL
3. **Idempotent APIs**: Same message ID = same result
4. **Client retry logic**: Exponential backoff with jitter"

**👩‍💼 Sarah**: "What about the elephant in the room - how do you handle end-to-end encryption at this scale?"

**🧑‍💻 You**: "That's the beautiful part - encryption actually simplifies the server design:

1. **Signal Protocol**: Double Ratchet for 1-to-1, Sender Keys for groups
2. **Client-side only**: Server never sees plaintext, just encrypted blobs
3. **Key distribution**: Initial key exchange via server, then direct peer-to-peer
4. **Performance**: Encryption/decryption on device, server just routes binary data

The server becomes a 'dumb pipe' - it doesn't care about content, just delivery."

**👩‍💼 Sarah**: "Interesting. But what about search functionality? How do you search encrypted messages?"

**🧑‍💻 You**: "Ah, that's a trade-off. Options:
1. **Client-side search**: Download and decrypt locally (WhatsApp's approach)
2. **Encrypted search**: Homomorphic encryption (too slow at scale)
3. **Metadata search**: Search by participants, dates, not content

I'd go with option 1 - client downloads recent messages (last 30 days), indexes locally. For older messages, background sync as needed."

---

## ⚙️ Phase 5: Scaling & Bottlenecks (3 minutes)

**👩‍💼 Sarah**: "We're running out of time. What are your main scaling bottlenecks and how would you address them?"

**🧑‍💻 You**: "Top 3 bottlenecks and solutions:

**1. WebSocket Connections**
- **Problem**: 500M concurrent connections
- **Solution**: Shard users across gateway instances, use connection pooling

**2. Hot Partitions in Cassandra**
- **Problem**: Very active group chats create write hotspots
- **Solution**: Composite partition key (chat_id + time_bucket), distribute load

**3. Kafka Consumer Lag**
- **Problem**: Delivery workers can't keep up with message volume
- **Solution**: Auto-scaling worker pools, partition by user geography"

**👩‍💼 Sarah**: "How would you monitor this system?"

**🧑‍💻 You**: "Key metrics:
- **Message delivery latency**: P50, P95, P99 per region
- **Connection health**: WebSocket drops, reconnection rate  
- **Queue depth**: Kafka lag, worker processing time
- **Error rates**: Failed deliveries, encryption failures
- **Business metrics**: DAU, messages per user, retention

I'd use Prometheus + Grafana for metrics, Jaeger for distributed tracing."

**👩‍💼 Sarah**: "Last question - how would you handle a complete datacenter outage?"

**🧑‍💻 You**: "Multi-region disaster recovery:
1. **Active-Active setup**: Users pinned to closest region
2. **Cross-region replication**: Cassandra and Redis replicate async
3. **Message buffer**: Kafka retains 7 days, can replay after recovery
4. **Graceful degradation**: Read-only mode if write path fails
5. **Client resilience**: Apps cache messages locally, retry on reconnect

RTO target: 5 minutes. RPO target: 1 minute of messages max."

## 🎯 Wrap-Up & Follow-Up Questions

**👩‍💼 Sarah**: "Great job! A few rapid-fire questions:
- How would you add video calling?
- What about message reactions and threads?
- How would you prevent spam?"

**🧑‍💻 You**: 
"**Video calling**: WebRTC for P2P, STUN/TURN servers for NAT traversal, separate media service

**Reactions/threads**: New message types, parent_message_id foreign key, same delivery pipeline

**Spam prevention**: Rate limiting per user, ML models on message patterns, user reporting system with auto-moderation"

**👩‍💼 Sarah**: "Excellent. You showed strong system design skills and handled the complexity well. Any questions for me?"

**🧑‍💻 You**: "Thank you! I'm curious - what's been Meta's biggest technical challenge scaling WhatsApp from acquisition to now?"
